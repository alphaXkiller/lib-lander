In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which Life is Beautiful may be required to share or transfer Personal Information in our databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event.

		<h4>5.  ANONYMOUS DATA COLLECTED</h4>
		<p>In addition to the information you provide when you use <a href="http://www.lifeisbeautiful.com/">www.lifeisbeautiful.com</a>, Life is Beautiful uses technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our Web Site.  For example, we use technology to track how many visitors access our Web Site, the date and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and which pages they view.  We also use technology to determine which web browsers our visitors use and the address from which they accessed our sites (for example, if they connected to the Web Site by clicking on a banner ad).</p>
		<p>This technology does not identify you personally.  It simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of the Web Site.  Life is Beautiful and our Affiliates use this anonymous data and share it with third-parties to improve the content and functionality of our Web Site, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services.</p>
		<h4>6.  COOKIES</h4>
		<p>A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies do not damage your computer, and they cannot be used to discover the identity of a user.  You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.  This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not, and whether you are required to accept the cookie to view certain content.  Life is Beautiful may use cookies to “persist” a user session — that is, to maintain connection with a user as he or she moves through an application or series of web pages.  The purpose of cookies in this context is to remember user inputs.  Personalization features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate content and services.</p>
		<h4>7.  OPT IN/OPT OUT</h4>
		<p>As noted in Use of Customer Information above, Life is Beautiful will not provide your nonpublic Personal Information to Affiliated Parties unless you have opted in to receive emails from the Affiliated Parties.  If, at any time, you desire that Life is Beautiful cease providing your nonpublic Personal Information to Affiliated Parties, you may opt out of those disclosures by directing us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law).  If you receive communications from us that you do not want to receive, you may opt out of receiving those communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or emailing us at info@lifeisbeautiful.com.  Occasionally it is necessary to send out a service-related announcement.  Generally, users may not opt out of these communications.  These communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
		<h4>8.  THIRD-PARTIES</h4>
		<p>Life is Beautiful may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third-parties, though such summary information will not identify any specifics related to you.  We may use the Personal Information you provide to administer Web Site usage and monitor traffic-levels, and to contact you regarding improvements we can make to our Web Site and our services, if necessary.  Life is Beautiful may engage third-parties to perform functions on its behalf, such as sending newsletters, postal mail and e-mail, analyzing and processing data, payment processing, and providing customer service.  Life is Beautiful requires that these parties agree to use Personal Information in compliance with this privacy policy, and in accordance with any other appropriate confidentiality and security procedures.  These parties may have access to Customer Information needed to perform their functions, but Life is Beautiful will not authorize them to use it for purposes that do not conform to this privacy policy.
